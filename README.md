# my_tt_mini_game
This is my small project creating a table tennis minigame with python pygame
*!!! TODO !!! Code Refactoring !!!*
Some basics are allready done. The next steps imply:
  - Add characters and their movement
  - Different behavior of the ball (topspin, backspin)
  - improvment of the oop design
  - some simple AI for the opponent
  - rework the sprites
  - clean-up the code
