# my_tt_mini_game
This is my small project creating a table tennis minigame with python pygame


To start the game install the requirements and run main.py


Only arcade mode is working as of now. To reserve the ball press space.


*!!! TODO !!! Code Refactoring !!!*


Next steps imply:

  - Different behavior of the ball (topspin, backspin)
  - improvment of the oop design
  - rework the sprites
  - clean-up the code
