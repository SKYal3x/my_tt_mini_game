# my_tt_mini_game
This is my small project creating a table tennis minigame with python pygame

Some basics are allready done. The next steps imply:
  - Characters movement and on the physics of the ball.
  - States of the ball (serve, hit, etc.) with different behavior
  - improvment of the oop design
  - some simple AI for the opponent
  - maybe some nices sprites and animations
